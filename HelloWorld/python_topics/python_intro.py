# intro :
# used for web development, software development, mathematics, system scripting.
# used on a server to create web applications, used alongside to create workflows.
# can connect to dbs and can read and modify files.
# used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
# used for rapid prototyping, for production ready software development.
# possible to write python in IDE( Integrated Development Environment).

print("Hello World!")
exit()

# output : Hello World!


# syntax : syntax will start with print and and ends with brackets.
# mentioning various types of variables and to run the program syntax is required.
# can store integer, float, string or complex numbers in variables.

# comments : will start with #. this can be useful to understand the code clearly.
# comments are not come under code.
# if the comment is more than one line, we can write the entire comment in three quotes.


# variable : variable is to store some data values.
# the data might be in the form of int, float, string.
# to know the data type we can write a syntax.
# we can mention string data type in single or double quotes.
# if it is more than one more line we can write in three quotes.
# variable names can be case sensitive, alpha-numeric characters and underscores.
# variable names cannot starts with any symbols like @ , $ ,etc and cannot starts with numeric.
# variable can be camel case (myVariableName) or pascal case(MyVariableName) or snake case(my_variable_case).

# Assign multiple variables :
# we can assign multiple variables in one line.
# and we can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line.
